                <h1>Computer Science Student</h1>
                <p>Sixty-four thousand users and counting. What I originally
                    envisioned as just a casual summer Discord bot project for
                    collecting characters from shows in a trading card fashion,
                    garnered more attention than what me and the team I led
                    could
                    ever expected.</p>
                <p>I love to build, to create, to make something my very own
                    from
                    nothing. I have loved the craft of engineering since the
                    times I
                    could pick up a wooden block. Throughout my experiences with
                    drag-and-drop programming as a child and more powerful
                    programming languages like Java and Python, I have found
                    that
                    Computer Science is the most accessible way to engineering
                    projects in our modern world. Regardless of identity,
                    status, or
                    environment, an internet connection unlocks access to the
                    world's most powerful toolkit.</p>
                <p>Now, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at
                    Texas A&M to advance my current mostly self-taught
                    understanding
                    and go on to build bigger and better projects. Specifically
                    within Computer Science, I am interested in Data Science and
                    Cybersecurity. I have just completed my first semester with
                    a
                    4.0/4.0 GPA in the Engineering Honors Program.</p>
                <p class="highlight">Highlight of Experiences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Published a scientific peer-reviewed paper in the
                        journal
                        Solar Energy that detailed the transformation of the
                        solar
                        cell material double perovskite to halve the costs of
                        solar
                        panels and entirely eliminate toxic byproduct production</li>
                    <li>Designed an AI model that predicts computational fluid
                        dynamic simulations set-up which would cut back
                        thousands of
                        dollars and hours for training. Research paper currently
                        under review.</li>
                    <li>Assembled sample machine learning model and standardized
                        benchmarks at MSBAI that was responsible for a critical
                        part
                        of developing the AI agent GURU. This service was later
                        selected by the U.S. Air Force for the $1 million
                        contract

                    <li>Conducted and cleanly compiled thorough, efficient, and
                        timely due diligence research at MicroVentures which
                        supported many successful offerings on the platform such
                        as
                        Sila Nanotechnologies which raised $655 thousand within
                        24
                        hours.</li>
