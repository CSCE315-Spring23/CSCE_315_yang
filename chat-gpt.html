            <h1>Professional Presence Website</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my professional presence website, showcasing my
                experience and skills in the fields of computer science, data
                science, and cybersecurity. </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a passion for building and creating projects from scratch.
                I first became interested in engineering through drag-and-drop
                programming as a child and have since discovered the power and
                accessibility of computer science. I am currently pursuing a
                Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Texas A&M, where I have
                a 4.0/4.0 GPA in the Engineering Honors Program. My main
                interests are in Data Science and Cybersecurity. </p>
            <h2>Highlight of Experiences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Published a scientific peer-reviewed paper in the journal
                    Solar Energy that detailed the transformation of the solar
                    cell material double perovskite to halve the costs of solar
                    panels and entirely eliminate toxic byproduct production.</li>
                <li>Designed an AI model that predicts computational fluid
                    dynamic simulations set-up which would cut back thousands of
                    dollars and hours for training. Research paper currently
                    under review.</li>
                <li>Assembled sample machine learning model and standardized
                    benchmarks at MSBAI that was responsible for a critical part
                    of developing the AI agent GURU. This service was later
                    selected by the U.S. Air Force for the $1 million contract
                    AFWERX Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Contract.</li>
                <li>Conducted and cleanly compiled thorough, efficient, and
                    timely due diligence research at MicroVentures which
                    supported many successful offerings on the platform such as
                    Sila Nanotechnologies which raised $655 thousand within 24
                    hours.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Internship Inquiry</h2>
            <p>I am currently seeking an internship for the summer of 2023 in
                the fields of software engineering, data science, or
                cybersecurity. If you think I could be a potential candidate,
                please reach out to me. I would love to discuss in greater
                detail.</p>

                prompt: 
                <br>
                please write me a professional presence website html that
                incorporates the following information:
                <br>
                Sixty-four thousand users and counting. What I originally
                envisioned as just a casual summer Discord bot project for
                collecting characters from shows in a trading card fashion,
                garnered more attention than what me and the team I led could
                ever expected.
                <br>
                I love to build, to create, to make something my very own from
                nothing. I have loved the craft of engineering since the times I
                could pick up a wooden block. Throughout my experiences with
                drag-and-drop programming as a child and more powerful
                programming languages like Java and Python, I have found that
                Computer Science is the most accessible way to engineering
                projects in our modern world. Regardless of identity, status, or
                environment, an internet connection unlocks access to the
                world's most powerful toolkit.
                <br>
                Now, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at
                Texas A&M to advance my current mostly self-taught understanding
                and go on to build bigger and better projects. Specifically
                within Computer Science, I am interested in Data Science and
                Cybersecurity. I have just completed my first semester with a
                4.0/4.0 GPA in the Engineering Honors Program.
